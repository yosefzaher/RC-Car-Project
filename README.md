Overview:-
__________________
This RC Car project, brought to you by ENG. Yosef Zaher, utilizes Arduino for control, an L298N Motor Driver for motor control, and an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless communication. The car is powered by a 12V battery with a built-in Battery Management System (BMS). It features four 80 RPM DC motors for motion.

Hardware Requirements :-
_____________________________________
  1-Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
  2-Motor Driver: L298N
  3-Bluetooth Module: HC-05
  4-DC Motors: 4 x 80 RPM
  5-Chassis and Wheels
  6-Power Supply:
  12V Battery with BMS for the entire system
  3-Jumper Wires
  4-Android/iOS Device with Bluetooth capability


Software Requirements :-
___________________________________________________
  1-Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
  2-Bluetooth Terminal App (e.g., Arduino Bluetooth RC Car app on Android)

Wiring Instructions :-
_________________________________________________
  1-Connect the four 80 RPM DC Motors to the Motor Driver (L298N).
  2-Connect the Motor Driver to the Arduino Board.
  3-Connect the Bluetooth Module (HC-05) to the Arduino Board.
  4-Ensure that the 12V battery with BMS powers both the Arduino and the Motor Driver along with the DC Motors.

Bluetooth Connection :-
_______________________________
  1-Power on the RC car and ensure the Bluetooth module is paired with your smartphone or device.
  2-Open the Bluetooth Terminal App on your smartphone.
  3-Connect to the Bluetooth module from the app.

Usage :-
__________________________________
  Open the Arduino Bluetooth RC Car app on your smartphone.
  Connect to the Bluetooth module.
  Use the on-screen controls to drive the RC car (forward, backward, left, right).
  Enjoy controlling your RC car wirelessly!

Troubleshooting :-
_____________________________
  If the RC car is not responding, check the wiring connections.
  Ensure that the Bluetooth module is properly paired with your smartphone.
  Verify that the power supply is providing sufficient power to the motors.
